Timmy's Usage Examples
=======================
Pascal source files in this folder are demonstrations of the Timmy unit.
They aren't licensed.  
If you are trying to compile the examples in a GNU/Linux system (or any system
that can execute Shell script without troubles), you can use the `mkexample.sh`
file. It is supposed to be made executable so that you can run it using
`./mkexample.sh` instead of `sh mkexample.sh`, but in case it is not,
do a `chmod +x mkexample.sh`.

What does each of these examples demonstrate?
---------------------------------------------
1. `01.pas`: Basic usage of Timmy - Adding and answering
2. `02.pas`: Passing functions into `TTimmy.Add()`, adding and removing the same keywords data, and `StrSplit()`
3. `03.pas`: Adding pointers as data
