record
======

Description
-----------
  Start or end a record session. During a record session, any input submitted
  by the user to the Shell is recorded, as long as the input is valid.
  When the user terminates the record session, all recorded inputs are then
  written to a text file with the name "inputs.rec", placed in the shell/
  directory.

Arguments
---------
    record [status|start|begin|stop|quit|end]

  If no argument is passed over, start a record session if none hasn't started,
  or end the current record session if recording.

  Take at most 1 argument. There are 6 valid arguments. They are:
    1. status
        Print out the status of the recorder. The status includes whether if
        there's an active recording process running or not, and if there's
        a recording session running, print out how many inputs have been
        recorded.
    2. start, begin
        Start a recording session. Print a warning if a recording session is
        running.
    3. stop, quit, end
        End recording session and write the record to inputs.rec.
        If there's no recording session, print a warning.
