init
====

Description
-----------
Initialize the test instance. This is the test command for 'TTimmy.Init()'.

Arguments
---------
  Just as TTimmy.Init() requires parameters, so does the init command requires
  arguments. The usage goes as follow:

    init [PERCENT DEFAULTREP DUPECHECK]

  If no argument is specified, there will be prompts asking for value of each
  of the required inputs to TTimmy.Init() and you have to manually enter them.
  For the first and last prompt (out of 3 prompts), if you enter an empty
  string, the procedure stops and you are back with the Shell input prompt
  with the instance yet to be initialized.

  If you do specify arguments, however, you have to specify all the arguments to
  TTimmy.Init(), namely, values for 'Percent', 'DefaultRep', and 'DpCheck' of
  constructor Init(). The first argument is regarded as value for 'Percent',
  and, of course, it must be a whole number. The last argument is considered
  the value for 'DpCheck', which, you should enter either "true" or "false".
  Anything between the first and the last argument is regarded as the value
  for 'DefaultRep'. Even the space counts. For example:

    init 70    Sorry,    it seems like I don't understand that     False

  In the example above, 70 is value for 'Percent', 'False' is value for DpCheck,
  and '   Sorry,    it seems like I don't understand that    ' is value for
  DefaultRep. 1 space is used to delimit between the value of DefaultRep and
  other arguments.

  If you specify only two arguments, the command will throw an error.

Errors
------
  If no argument is specified, prompts will ask you for the arguments. If you
  enter invalid values to the prompts, a warning will be thrown and you have to
  enter again.

  If you specify arguments but specify only two arguments, an error is thrown.
  If you specify invalid values for 'Percent' and 'DpCheck', an error is thrown.
