SHELL INPUT PROMPT
==================

  When you enter Timmy Interactive Shell, you are greeted with the input prompt.
  It's a field where you type in your Shell input. It starts with two greater
  than sign ('>'), following by a space. Once you've typed something, you can
  use the left arrow key to move the cursor to the left. Pressing the right
  arrow key has the opposite effect; it moves the cursor to the right. Hit Enter
  to submit your input. Once you've submitted at least one input, you can press
  the up arrow key to go to the previous input. The down arrow key moves you to
  the next input in the input history.

COMMANDS AND ARGUMENTS
======================

  In Timmy Interactive Shell, an input can have two parts: the command and the
  argument(s). The command is the first word of the input, and is highlighted
  with a blue color in the input prompt. The arguments are all the things that
  follow the command and a space character that succeed the command. The
  arguments act as options to the command; They tell what the command must use
  to do the intended operation, or how the command should behave.

  Example:
    record -f inputcast.txt

  In the above input, "record" is the command, "-f" and "inputcast.txt" are the
  arguments. A command may not need an argument (such as the "exit" command).
  These are all the available commands in Timmy Interactive Shell:

    exit, quit, clear, help, record, exec, stat, set, echo, rename, init, add,
    remove, enable, disable, answer, strtrim, strreplace, strsplit, strjoin,
    comparestrarrays

  To get help with a command, type "help COMMAND", replacing COMMAND with the
  name of the command that you want to get help with.
