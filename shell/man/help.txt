help
====

Description
-----------
  Print a manual page to the console. Manual pages are stored in shell/man/.

Arguments
---------
    help [MANPAGE]

  The help command takes at most 1 argument. If you specify 2 or more arguments,
  only the first argument is taken, the rest is ignored. The argument should
  be the name of the manual entry that you want to read. There are manual pages
  for commands in Timmy Interactive Shell. You can type "help MANPAGE",
  replacing "MANPAGE" with the name of the command you want to get help with.
  For example, "help rename" will print out the manual page for the 'rename'
  command. If you specify no argument or specify "shell" as the first argument,
  the general manual for Timmy Interactive Shell is printed. If you type
  "help program", the program's help is printed, just as if you were to invoke
  the option "-h" or "--help" with the Shell.

Errors
------
  An error is thrown if the manual page could not be found or the IO check
  yields error (IOResult <> 0) during the file-reading operation.
