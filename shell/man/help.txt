help
====

Description
-----------
  Print manual page(s) to the console. Manual pages are stored in shell/man/.

Arguments
---------
    help [MANPAGE1 [MANPAGE2 MANPAGE3 ...]]

  The help command takes as many arguments as you wish. If you do not throw any
  argument to it, the main manual page for the Shell (shell/man/shell.txt) will
  be printed. Otherwise, the command will print the manual entries for all the
  manual page names you've specified.

  Examples:
    help fexec
   -> Print the manual page for the fexec command

    help record rename clear
   -> Print the manual pages of the commands 'record', 'rename; and 'clear' in
      that same order

    help program
   -> Print out Timmy Interactive Shell's detailed information

    help options
   -> Print the command line options usage for Timmy Interactive Shell, which is
      the same as invoking the Shell with -h or --help option

Errors
------
  An error is thrown if the manual page could not be found or the IO check
  yields error (IOResult <> 0) during the file-reading operation.

Exit code values
----------------
  20: All specified manual pages were successfully read
  21: No manual entry for the given manual name found in shell/man/
  22: Manual entry exists, but somehow the program failed to read from it
      (IOResult <> 0)
  23: Not all specified manual pages were successfully read
