exec
====

Description
-----------
  Execute inputs in given files. Order of executing is from left to right
  (first argument to last argument). In each file, every input is on its own
  line, and the file is executed from the first line to the last line.

Arguments
---------
    exec FILE1 [FILE2 FILE3 FILE4 FILE5 ...]

  Examples:
    exec inputs.rec
    exec /home/frank/pas/script /home/frank/sh/f.txt ../../../bot_test.txt

Errors
------
  An error is thrown when at least one of the following is true:
  - You do not pass any argument to the exec command
  - A file does not exist. It will be ignored and the exec command will continue
    executing inputs from other files.
  - IO check result is not 0 (IOResult <> 0). Again, that file will be ignored.
