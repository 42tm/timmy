exec
====

Description
-----------
  Execute inputs in given files. Order of executing is from left to right
  (first argument to last argument). In each file, every input is on its own
  line, and the file is executed from the first line to the last line.

Arguments
---------
    exec FILE1 [FILE2 FILE3 FILE4 FILE5 ...]

  Examples:
    exec inputs.rec
    exec /home/frank/pas/script /home/frank/sh/f.txt ../../../bot_test.txt

Errors
------
  An error is thrown when at least one of the following is true:
  - You do not pass any argument to the exec command
  - A file does not exist. It will be ignored and the exec command will continue
    executing inputs from other files.
  - IO check result is not 0 (IOResult <> 0). Again, that file will be ignored.

Exit code values
----------------
  Note: FExec has 2 functions returning exit code (TExitCode). One takes string
  and will be referred to as "FExec(String)" and one takes TStrArray and will be
  referred to as "FExec(TStrArray)".

  40: File(s) executed, even if the inputs in the file(s) caused errors
  41: { FExec(String) } Given file does not exist
  42: { FExec(String) } Failed to read (IOResult <> 0)
  43: { FExec(TStrArray) } Not all files were executed
  44: User did not give the command any file path as argument
