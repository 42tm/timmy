Timmy Interactive Shell - An environment for testing the Timmy unit

Timmy Interactive Shell is a program that can help you test or play around with
the Timmy unit. It uses Timmy Debug, which is a variant of Timmy that is only
slightly different in class visibility. Timmy Debug can be found as
timmy_debug.pas in the 'variants' folder.

Timmy Interactive Shell comes with commands to help you play around with Timmy,
and there are commands to test the methods of the TTimmy object provided by
Timmy. The Shell displays the results by showing the expected output and the
real output. There are also additional features to make things easier such as
input recording, session's input history, logging and executing from file.
