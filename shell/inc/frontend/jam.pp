    Various log messages of level TLogger.INFO are in the Shell.
    Some of them indicate that a process has been done successfully,
    some of them just tell the user something. To make log messages
    of TLogger.INFO even more suggestive, this procedure is here to help.
    It prints a pair of square brackets, and a small square between those
    square brackets. This small square is written in the text color DotColor
    (the one and only parameter to this procedure). The text color is what
    makes the log message more suggestive.

    Parameters:
        DotColor [Byte]: Numeric input for TextBackground() to write the "dots"
}
Procedure Jam(DotColor: Byte);
Begin
    TextColor(7); Write('[');
    TextColor(DotColor); Write('â–ª');
    TextColor(7); Write('] ');
End;
